title: My First Alexa Fact Skill

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my Bloc Apprenticeship, I moved on to learning another skill Alexa could utilize. It was even easier than when I started learning about making a trivia skill.  This time I was learning on how to make a fact skill for Alexa. Again, everything was well documented step by step. I ended up writing a fact skill about technology called Tech Facts.  The hardest part about it was looking up facts that I thought were interesting. The part I found interesting was how the code was updated. When learning the Trivia skill, we used a blank slate and uploaded the code in a .zip folder. With the fact skill I chose the fact template, which had a preloaded library and had to copy and paste the index file into their code editor. I suggest you take a look at their [github](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-fact) repoand start building a skill of your own.
