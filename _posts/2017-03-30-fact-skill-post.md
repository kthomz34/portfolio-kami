&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexa launch WoW Trivia, just kidding your'e not Alexa, but could you guess the correct answer based on this code?

            "Who was imprisoned by Maive Shadowsong for 10,000 years?": [
                "Illidan",
                "Thrall",
                "Jaina",
                "Varian",
                "Malfurion",
                "Tyrande"
            ]
        },
        {
            "During what expansion did the Thousand needles flood?": [
                "Cataclysm",
                "Vanilla",
                "The Frozen Throne",
                "Legion",
                "Warlords of Draenor",
                "Mists of Pandaria"
            ]
        },
        
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you guessed "Illidan" for question one you are correct and "Cataclysm" for question two, you are also correct. If you are not a WoW wiz but you knew some Alexa trivia skill coding, it would not have mattered since the correct question is always the first one in the code.  Good thing for the trivia users looking for a challenge Alexa randomizes the answers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my Bloc Apprenticeship, I moved on to learning another skill Alexa could utilize. It was even easier than when I started learning about making a trivia skill.  This time I was learning on how to make a fact skill for Alexa. Again, everything was well documented step by step. I ended up writing a fact skill about technology called Tech Facts.  The hardest part about it was looking up facts that I thought were interesting. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The part I found interesting was how the code was updated. When learning the Trivia skill, we used a blank slate and uploaded the code in a .zip folder. I chose the fact template, which had a preloaded library and had to copy and paste the index file into their code editor. I suggest you take a look at their [github](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-fact) repository to start building a skill of your own.
